A small personal exercise for me to re-learn C, C++ and the rudimentary Data Structures I should of remembered from school.  Since I currently work in a Java environment, the resulting code may look funky.

I am using [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) to unit test both the C and C++ codebases.
