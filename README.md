KwazCollections
===============

A small personal exercise for me to re-learn C, C++ and the rudimentary Data Structures I should of remembered from school.  Since I currently work in a Java environment, the resulting code may look funky.

Since I'm sure there are many other far superior collection libraries out there, this software is released under the BSD liscence.
I only ask (but not require) that if someone manages to actually look at this code, please offer advice (and fixes?!?).

This is currently being coded on a 32 bit LXDE Fedora VM running on Windows 7 64.
I'm only using a 32 bit VM to keep down on memory usage.

I am using [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) to unit test both the C and C++ codebases.
